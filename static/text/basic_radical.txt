    Pour dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) from a beaker into a test tube containing salt solution.
    No precipitate formed in test tube indicating absence of Pb2+. 
    Pour hydrogen sulphide from beaker to test tube. 
    Black precipitate is formed in test tube indicating presence of Cu2+.
    Pour nitric acid (HNO3) from conical flask to test tube.
    Solution in test tube turns green.
    Divide the solution into two and pour ammonium Nitrate (NH4OH) solution from beaker to test tube containing one part. 
    Solution in test tube turns blue confirming presence of Cu2+.
    Pour Potassium ferrocyanide solution from conical flask to test tube containing second part. 
    Chocolate brown precipitate of Copper ferrocyanide is formed in test tube confirming the presence of Cu2+ ions.
    Add a few drops of dilute H2SO4 sulphuric acid from a container to a small quantity of the salt in a test tube.
    No changes observed.
    Take a small chunk of the salt in a test tube and add a few drops of concentrated H2SO4 sulphuric acid from a container to it.
    Reddish-brown fumes of gas are evolved from the test tube.
    Anion maybe Bromide (Br-).
    Add silver nitrate from a conical flask to the salt solution in the test tube.
    Yellow precipitate is formed in the test tube which is partially soluble in ammonium hydroxide.
    Anion is confirmed to be Bromide.
    Therefore the salt is confirmed to be Copper Bromide.
